# heh

Rust implementation of the [xoroshiro128+, xorshift1024*Ï†,
splitmix64](http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it), and [Linnorm](https://github.com/tommyettinger/sarong)
random number generators.

Heh is [an Ancient Egyptian deity of primordial chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heh_(god)),
which makes some sense for a random number generator library.
